# Coustmer Segmentation Using K-Means Clustering
#
## Objective:
The primary goal of this project is to segment customers into distinct groups based on their purchasing behavior using K-Means Clustering. This will allow businesses to better understand their customer base, identify different customer profiles, and tailor marketing strategies to each segment.
#
## Problem Statement:
In the competitive business landscape, understanding customers' needs and behaviors is crucial. Instead of treating all customers the same, businesses can benefit from segmenting them into different groups. These segments can help target marketing efforts, optimize product recommendations, and improve customer retention. The aim is to use unsupervised learning (K-Means Clustering) to identify patterns in customer data and group them into distinct segments.


## Project Scope:
* Data Collection: Obtain or create a dataset that includes various customer attributes such as age, income, spending habits, purchase frequency, and product preferences.

* Data Preprocessing: Clean and prepare the dataset by handling missing values, normalizing the data, and selecting relevant features for clustering.

* Model Development:

Implement K-Means Clustering, an unsupervised learning algorithm, to cluster customers into distinct groups based on the features provided.
Use the Elbow method or Silhouette Score to determine the optimal number of clusters (K).
Analysis: Analyze the characteristics of each customer segment to draw business insights.

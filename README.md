# Coustmer Segmentation Using K-Means Clustering
#
## Objective:
The primary goal of this project is to segment customers into distinct groups based on their purchasing behavior using K-Means Clustering. This will allow businesses to better understand their customer base, identify different customer profiles, and tailor marketing strategies to each segment.
#
## Problem Statement:
In the competitive business landscape, understanding customers' needs and behaviors is crucial. Instead of treating all customers the same, businesses can benefit from segmenting them into different groups. These segments can help target marketing efforts, optimize product recommendations, and improve customer retention. The aim is to use unsupervised learning (K-Means Clustering) to identify patterns in customer data and group them into distinct segments.
#
## Project Scope:
* Data Collection: Obtain or create a dataset that includes various customer attributes such as age, income, spending habits, purchase frequency, and product preferences.

* Data Preprocessing: Clean and prepare the dataset by handling missing values, normalizing the data, and selecting relevant features for clustering.

* Model Development:
 Implement K-Means Clustering, an unsupervised learning algorithm, to cluster customers into distinct groups based on the features provided.
 Use the Elbow method or Silhouette Score to determine the optimal number of clusters (K).

* Analysis: Analyze the characteristics of each customer segment to draw business insights.
#
## Tools & Technologies:
* Programming Language: Python 
* Libraries:
* Pandas: For data manipulation and preprocessing
* NumPy: For numerical operations
* Matplotlib/Seaborn: For data visualization
* scikit-learn: For implementing the K-Means algorithm and evaluating clustering performance
* Dataset: You can use publicly available datasets like:
 Kaggle’s "Mall Customers Dataset"
 Retail datasets from UCI Machine Learning Repository

Methodology:
Step 1: Data Collection

Collect customer data such as:
Age
Annual Income
Spending Score (a score that rates the customer’s spending behavior)
Purchase frequency
Product preferences
Example dataset structure:

CustomerID	Age	Annual Income	Spending Score	Purchases Frequency
001	        25	 45,000	         80	             12
002	        35	  75,000	       50	             20
...	...	...	...	...
Step 2: Data Preprocessing

Handle any missing or inconsistent values in the dataset.
Normalize the data using standardization techniques (e.g., MinMaxScaler or StandardScaler) to ensure all features are on a similar scale.
Visualize the data to get an overview of potential clusters (scatter plots, pair plots).
Step 3: K-Means Clustering

K-Means Algorithm:

Randomly initialize K centroids.
Assign each customer to the nearest centroid based on the Euclidean distance.
Recompute the centroids as the mean of the customers in each cluster.
Repeat the assignment and recomputation steps until the centroids no longer change (convergence).
Choosing K (Number of Clusters):

Use the Elbow Method: Plot the within-cluster sum of squares (WCSS) against the number of clusters and look for the "elbow" point where the curve starts to flatten. This indicates the optimal number of clusters.
Silhouette Score: Evaluate the quality of the clustering by measuring how close each point in one cluster is to the points in neighboring clusters. A higher score indicates well-defined clusters.
Step 4: Model Evaluation

Once the clusters are defined, visualize them using 2D or 3D scatter plots.
Examine the centroid values of each cluster to understand the distinguishing characteristics of each group.
Interpret the business implications of each segment (e.g., high-income high-spenders vs. low-income infrequent buyers).
Step 5: Analysis and Business Insights

Profile each customer segment to understand the key differences:

Segment A: Young, high-spending customers with moderate incomes.
Segment B: Older, high-income customers who spend less frequently.
Segment C: Mid-age, moderate spenders with stable purchasing habits.
Use these segments to:

Tailor marketing campaigns for each customer group.
Optimize product recommendations.
Implement targeted promotions for high-value customers.
